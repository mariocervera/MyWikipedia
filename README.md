# My Wikipedia

This repository contains a responsive web application that supports content search in [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).
The web application is simply a prototype, but it allows the user to select among ten different languages, five of which contain
non-latin characters. To retrieve content from Wikipedia, the web application uses the Wikipedia [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/).

TODO: retrieve full content (not only first section) and include images.
